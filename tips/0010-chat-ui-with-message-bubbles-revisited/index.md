# Chat UI with message bubbles (revisited)

Remember this thread about how to create a chat with message bubbles?

Well, I found a simpler and more performant solution.

Let's get back to basics. üßµ

What we want to do is to *align* our message bubble to the left or right as needed.

We *could* accomplish this using a Row with MainAxisAlignment.start or MainAxisAlignment.end.

But that leads to an unconstrained width issue and breaks our layout in certain cases.

This *could* be fixed with LayoutBuilder + ConstrainedBox. But there's a better way.

What if we could *align* the child widget *without* using a Row?

Well, turns out a simple *Align* widget does the trick:

And with this change, the text inside each message bubble will wrap over multiple lines if needed.

Albert Einstein said it best:

"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

Turns out, this is great advice for Flutter app development.

Happy coding!
